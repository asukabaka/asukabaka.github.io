  <h3>ART108 Blog 3 - Paper Prototype</h3>
  <br><br>
  <h4>Core Mechanics - King of the Hill, Moving multiple units, Grid Movement
</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>The concept for my paper prototype is a turn based strategy game themed on the Japanese civil war that ended the Shogunate and brought about the modern day Japanese government. I originally wanted to carry over the first iterations theme of ninjas but found the lore and world building to be surprisingly difficult. I found that theming my game on an actual conflict fit the tone of massive scale warfare slightly better.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is a two player game where one player plays as the Ishin Ishi (what eventually becomes modern day Japan’s government) and the Shinsengumi( shogunate holdouts.) They take turns controlling all units available to them to try and capture the other opponents base. 

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     Each player has a movement phase where they can move their units by a certain amount of spaces. Combat phase starts when a piece moves on top of an opponent's piece. Combat is decided with an advantage and disadvantage system. Certain units will be more effective against other units.

  <h5>Play log 1 - During my first playthrough I found the game to be very restrictive. While the board looked very visually compelling, movement was slightly confusing and the process of deciding which pieces a player could move during their turn was very RNG dependent. The amount of spaces each piece could move was also very RNG dependent as it was decided on a dice roll.

  <h5>Play log 2 - Even with a redesign of the board I found movement and how pieces interacted with each other to be slightly difficult to understand. I found the very linear pathways reminiscent of MOBA’s with DoTA and League which I found to be very promising though. Again I found that deciding how pieces should move based on a spin was too RNG and removed any aspect of strategy the whole advantage and disadvantage combat system had to offer.

  <h5>Play log 3 - With the completely redesigned board, I wanted to still keep elements of the previous two iterations, mainly the 5 points of interest to make the game less linear and more asymmetric. Also movement and combat had dice spins completely removed from the equation. Movement was a set amount for each piece just like chess and all units were available to move each turn. During this playthrough I really appreciated the more freedom of movement for your pieces. This playthrough was much less RNG dependent though I came to find out it was a lot more predictable in maybe a bad way? The game definitely felt like there was more agency and user input. At the same time it felt kind of boring and unsatisfying. 
<br><br>
I really wish I have had more experience playing more board games so I actually know what makes a “fun” board game “fun.” It feels like copying a bunch of mechanics from established games like Fire Emblem of PVP Arathi Basin isn’t the same without the visual spectacle. For me personally I found the “fun” part of Fire Emblem was playing it like a dating sim, and the “fun” part of PVP in WoW was actually the combat and less so the territory capture. Maybe that is why my game feels kind of bland right now because none of these elements are in my game. Maybe "fun" board games are fun because they leverage the fact that you are interacting with you table mates in ways other than trying to kill their pieces? These are just some thoughts for my next game.
