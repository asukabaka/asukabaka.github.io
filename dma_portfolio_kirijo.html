    <h3>Inspired by the Japanese animated series Violet Evergarden, this fictional promotional image focuses on mechanics and proportions of the hand. The opportunity was also taken to do some world building for the series by developing a brand indentity for Kirijo Dynamics, a fictional robotics company featured in many of my other illustrations.<br>(Raymond Lam, Photoshop, 2019)</h3>
