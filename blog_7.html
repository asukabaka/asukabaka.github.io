  <h3>ART108 Blog 7 - Jackbox Games</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h5>In the age of COVID-19 and Shelter in Place orders, Jackbox games have become an unusually appropriate representation of how communities of people keep in touch. Jackbox games are played as multiplayer games. Notably, Jackbox games tend to have simple requirements in terms of physical requirements, so no complex DND board games with fancy pieces and die. Often Jackbox games lean on trivia as a game theme and leverage human interaction with others as a game mechanic.

  <br>
  The points above were a huge part of the experience playing with the class. Despite being physically separated but still able to communicate through teleconferencing, many Jackbox game mechanics translated well, and were fun to play. I think again, this was because the rules were often very simple. This blended well with the whole community aspect of Jackbox games, for me personally, this spent more of my focus on interacting and having fun with others.
<br><br>
It was a breath of fresh air to be able to sit back in a Jackbox games section and just observe and take in the banter, chit chat, and conversations. It made me oddly nostalgic of being able to just sit in class. Here's to hoping this whole mess blows over soon because I miss being on campus!
