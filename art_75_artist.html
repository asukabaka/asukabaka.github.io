    <h3>am a hyper motivated digital artist with over eight years of experience with
multiple mediums and systems. Inspired by bold, edgy, and precise design
philosophies. I am multilingual, with vast amount of applicable knowledge and
experiences with Asian cultures including: Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese.
My passion for art stems from the fact that their visual fantasy belies the real
world power in which they hold.<br><br>
In science fiction, technology is often depicted as the next step in human
evolution. Technological advancements, along with my personal experiences, has made
me more acutely aware of the ways technology can help those struggling with
impairments and disabilities. With art, I am able to dream of a future where technology
acts as the ultimate equalizer, empowering those who need it most.<br><br>
Whether designing more accessible user interfaces, or imagining technology of
the future through illustrations, my goal as an artist is to set the stage for tomorrow.
Dreaming, illustrating, and modeling in 3D wonderful and fantastic technologies
like cutting edge cybernetics, I strive to ignite the minds of engineers and scientists
alike, giving them a direction to focus their efforts.<br><br>
Many of my personal illustrations are driven by the idea of technological
assistance. For example, No Impossible Frontiers illustrates a future where prosthetics
have become such that they are nearly imperceptible on the surface. This idea stems
from the fact that many disabled want to be treated like any other person.<br><br>
My goal in the San Jose State University Digital Media Art program is to further
hone my foundational artistic skills, but more importantly, explore exciting new
technologies and platforms to showcase my art with. By combining different systems,
platforms, and technologies, I am able to create more impactful experiences. My second
semester has already produced one such example. Marrying code with art, I combined
Javascript with artwork drawn in Photoshop, creating an animated and visually dynamic
experience.<br><br>
I do not plan on stopping there, having already set my sights on other
technologies available at SJSU, like 3D modelling and printing. The futuristic and flashy
aesthetic of many of my pieces make them promising candidates to showcase how the
generally isolated spheres of art and engineering should more often enhance and
compliment each other.</h3>
