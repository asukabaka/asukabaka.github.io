  <h3>ART108 Blog 2 - Board Games</h3>
  <br>
  <h5>Our group played the board games Brandon Becker brougt to class! As someone who has never played a board game before I found his games to be a good fit for me. They were very simple and easy to understand. I really agree with your point in your lecture that board games are inherently a social experience as opposed to modern computer games, which are mainly made for the single players. Increasingly, even MMO's, which were once predominantly multiplayer experiences are being streamlined to be more accessible to solo players.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The first game our group played was Worst-Case Scenario which was definitely an experience. To quickly summarize my thoughts about it, I had more fun learning all the trivia (more like laugh at how ridiculous some of the scenarios were) than actually interacting with the game mechanics. That might be the whole point of the game though! The mechanics were really easy. You just role the dice and move spaces and answer trivia questions as if your "life" depended on it. You can collect coins to try and buy the fancy mansion at the end of the game, or if you collect no coins you end up on skid row( I found the whole Skid Row part a bit tasteless in modern times but can understand that the homelessness epidemic was not nearly as severe when this game was made.)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     I can definitely see your point about Worst-Case Scenario being biased towards certain genders/cultures. I found "guy" related questions to be way more common that feminine oriented ones. Also many of the questions would be biased towards western "rule of thumbs" or acquired knowledge. In hindsight when the game was made I'm sure it was catered to that specific demographic that would know all this kind of trivia. The Silicon Valley speficially is kind of a special case with how diverse it is. I would love to try out a Worst-Case Scenario game made in the last 5-10 years just to see how differently the game plays. Maybe it is more with the times. 
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     The next game our group played was Wits and Wagers - Party! It was a similar withe Worst-Case in that they were both trivia games. What sets Wits and Wagers [very] far apart from Worst-Case is the betting mechanic in which you can bet money on the answers the group comes up with. Even if a player does not know the answer to the trivia question, they still have the chance to rebound and potentially win the round by placing the right bet on other players answers. For example from our game, we were asked how much a painting made from elephant poo was worth. If there is a player that knows everything about artwork (or poo), you could watch what he places his bets on and make the same bet. Having this extra mechanic definitely adds a whole new layer to the game besides the very definite win or lose situation prevelant in Worst-Case.

  <h3>Session Report Peer Reviews</h3>
  <h5>Session Report 1 - Secret Hitler: I enjoyed reading your session report as it reads more as a story than perhaps a strict play by play. A slight suggestion would be to include a small summary of what the game is about and how it is played.
If you enjoy politics and playing Secret Hitler I highly recommend the point and click adventure game Disco Elysium which just released with unanimously glowing reviews.

Nice work!</h5>

  <h5>Session Report 2 - Sorry: You did a good job describing the difficult victory conditions in Sorry.
I also appreciated your inclusion of a brief summary of what the game was about and how to play it.
<br><br>
This seemed like an exciting experience for you.
<br><br>
Nice work!</h5>

<h5>Session Report 3 - You did a very good job describing what your experience playing Tokaido was like.
I was very impressed with your summaries of the different paths your group went. It illustrates how open ended the board game can be.
<br><br>
I appreciate the inclusion of your own photograph and this review has made me very interested in the game.
<br><br>
Nice work!</h5>
