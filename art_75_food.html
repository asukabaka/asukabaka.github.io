    <h3> The demo video is to to be projected in a gallery space and onto a table with various dishes (plates
and or bowls). Our project was inspired by Skullmapping’s “Le Petit Chef” which was made through
the use of 3D projection mapping technology. <br><br>This projection features a tiny chef preparing a meal
right onto the guest’s tables. We loved the interactivity and enjoyment their project was able to bring
and wanted to explore the overarching idea of what it means to share a meal and an experience,
either with a familiar face or a complete stranger. Sharing food has always been a way to connect and
form a bond, and so for our project, although simpler than Skullmappings’s, we decided to show a
dialogue between two people sharing a meal. Two bowls of food may not seem like much but we
hope that the audience will feel that it can be a much more intimate experience.<br><br>
The audience would experience the work in an open gallery space.<br><br> There will be a table with two
bowls across from each other - each having their own projector. The bowls will be filled with flat
white paper as to provide a better surface onto which the food will be projected onto. We plan to
include sounds such as talking and clattering sounds of silverware/dishware.</h3>
