  <h3>ART108 Blog 9 - Course Reflection</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h5>My biggest takeaway from this class was that making games is really hard. I can definitely see why large AAA studios are staffed with hundreds if not thousands of employees. The projects we were assigned started simple and slowly gained in complexity and scope. Making paper prototypes made it easy to try new things and meet new people. The initial Unity demo was a great way to get an introduction into the engine, as well as light programming. Finally, the final project was a chance to choose our own team and our own game, learning the importance of communication and scope. 
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, the steady assigned readings and quizzes were an effective way to learn more about game design, as well as some surface level psychology. Many themes and concepts learned in game design, like sound, UI, and interaction could be carried over to other mediums and careers.
<br><br>
I was fortunate to finish my final project with an awesome team comprised of Sabrina Chan as our character/asset artist, myself as background/assistant coder/ playtester, and finally the exception Minh Pham as our writer/ and coder, who had the programming chops to create a impressively complex game.
<br><br>
Overall this was a wonderful class and I felt that this was another step in my career as a student and artist. <br><br>Thank you James for being an awesome and passionate teacher!
