  <h3>ART108 Blog 4 - Digital Games</h3>
  <br><br>
  <h4>Thoughts on observing people play.
</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>The three stand out games for me in the lab were This Is the Only Level, Jurassic Heart, and Butterfly Soup. These games were notable to me because they are so far from the games I have been playing all my life. I mainly have played games from two categories, MMO and FPS games. Neither of these games were those two genres so I came in totally fresh, which I feel like made for a much more impactful experience. 

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
Observing someone playing This Is the Only Level was really entertaining in a totally different way than actually playing the game. In many ways, watching someone struggle through the game was both super hilarious and frustrating. Everytime I told my sister she sucked when I took over the controls I promptly died as well to add to the comedy. This kind of gameplay really reminded me of boardgames, where much of the fun came from the interaction with others, as opposed to playing the game by oneself. 

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
I think this kind of social gameplay is what makes watching Lets Plays and Twitch streams so prevalent today. Watching someone like my sister struggle through This Is the Only Level was oddly reminiscent of watching PewdiePie struggle through that one game where that guy in the pot is trying to climb a cliffside with a stick. It really begs the question if games have already been designed in a way to leverage the culture of streaming games.

  <h4>Games and cultural commentary</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>The two games Jurassic Heart and Butterfly Soup both have enough connections with each other to warrant a whole paper on it. Both were dating sims/ light novels that I feel have big influences from Japanese sims/novels. Their artistic styles were subtly Western in a way I can't really put a thumb on. Both games were very Western in their portrayal in romance though I thought.
<br><br><br>
While I make no claim to know everything about Japanese culture, I will say these two games had very progressive views on romance and politics that many Japanese games either shy away from or outright show disdain for. I found the lesbian romance in Butterfly Soup much more realistic and less fetishized for men in a way I appreciated.
