  <h4>List any known issues, and give instructions on how to play the game.
</h4>
  <br><br>
  <h5>Instructions: You try to jump to the final platform to reunite with your owner. Arrow Keys to move and space to jump. Be careful not to fall off the small platforms!
    <br>
    <br>
      Controls: Arrow keys to move left and right, space to jump, double space to double jump.
      <br>
      <br>
      Issues: Currently there are small issues where the play can fall through a small corner of the platform and not be teleported back. Also the NPC pathing can path her off a platform where she floats. Additionally testers have commented that it is not immediately clear the NPC is the dog's owner.

  <h4>Briefly discuss the game as it exists now (you may talk about what you would do with it, what is working now, about the journey from the alpha (last blog post))
</h4>
  <br><br>
  <h5>I am very happy with the game as it exists now. By sticking to simple goals and mechanics we were able to create a mechanically polished game with clear art direction and overall aesthetic. The snappy jumping and cute backstory matches the visual and audio experience for the play and there is no dissonance between the two. 

    <br>
    <br>
      This game was a product of an extraordinary time for everyone in the world. COVID19 was such a disruption to the daily lives that making something as intensive as a game seemed impossible. Nevertheless our group managed to make a product I am really happy with. By sticking to an extremely simple concept and few basic mechanics, we were able to program the game on schedule, and I had left over time to assist in the art assets for the game. Overall the game was complimented as a complete working package of art and gameplay, so I feel very happy with it and had a really meaningful and fun experience making it as well! the nature of the game made it a relaxing experience to work on and test.

      <br>
      <br>
      If I were to continue working on this game I would firstly polish small issues like NPC pathing and tweak the jumping numbers a bit. Then I would work on making the game longer and expand on the level building. I feel like there is potential for this game to be expanded upon for sure, and it wouldnâ€™t be too much work as the art direction and mechanics are already there. I would also like to fix the respawn mechanics of the game - I was unable to get the more complex respawn code where an instance of the player is spawned as opposed to the current workaround of just collision boxes teleporting the player around.
