  <h3>ART108 Blog 5 - First Playable</h3>
  <br><br>
  <h4>Name your game: A Way Back Home</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>Explain your role: Producer, Programmer, and assisted with Artist</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>Process:</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>From a programming perspective this game leaned heavily on youtube tutorials. I pretty much made the framework of a platformer using Brackey’s tutorials, and from there, I googled tutorials for specific chunks of code that I needed for the mechanic. For example, I wanted double jump, so I googled that, and tried out different kinds of tutorials and found one I managed to integrate with Brackey’s character controller - which I was really happy with as a beginner at programming. I used this process for the rest of the game mechanics.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
I also tried and played classic 2D platformers to see what made their game so fun to play and endeavored to incorporate specific feelings into mine as well. I also contributed a meaningful amount into the artwork for this game as well - directing the game to have the colorful and cartoony art direction, which was positively received.

  <h4>How did your players respond to your game?:</h4>
  <br><br>
  <h5>Overall testers gave reserved positive feedback. They noted that overall the setting, art, and concept was interesting but lacked in several areas as well. They noted that jumping was a bit buggy, there were issues with collision detection that needed to be ironed out. Also many testers noticed the level design was slightly present with thoughtful placement of peaches but the overall objective map beyond the small building was non-existent.

  <h4>What do you plan to change or keep in your game based on this feedback?:</h4>
  <br><br>
  <h5>If I were to continue on with the game, I would definitely make a meaningful effort to address all the issues brought forth above. Notably, I have already addressed the jump mechanics through a mixture of adjusting the collision boxes and the inputs given to the jumping script in Unity. Level design would be expanded to actually include a level after the tutorial stage. I would also love to add a bit of a narrative story along with menus and buttons etc.
